Project: FastTag and Gold Price Prediction
Repository Overview
This repository contains two main projects: a FastTag system implementation and a Gold Price Prediction model. It includes Jupyter Notebooks for running the code and a PDF report for detailed documentation of the fraud detection aspect in the FastTag project.


fasttag.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and analysis of the FastTag system.

fraud_detection.pdf: PDF document detailing the fraud detection mechanisms in the FastTag system.

goldprediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the Gold Price Prediction model.

FastTag Project
Description
The FastTag project is designed to streamline toll payments using RFID technology, ensuring a seamless and efficient process for vehicles passing through toll booths. The project includes a component focused on fraud detection to enhance security and reliability.

Files
fasttag.ipynb: Contains the code for the FastTag system implementation, including data processing, RFID simulation, and fraud detection algorithms.
fraud_detection.pdf: Provides a detailed report on the methods and results of fraud detection in the FastTag system.


Gold Price Prediction Project
Description
This project aims to predict gold prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate forecasts that can aid investors and analysts in making informed decisions.

Files
goldprediction.ipynb: Includes the data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation for predicting gold prices.
